                    <h1>Introduction to Scalp Electroencephalography (sEEG)</h1>
		   <span class="image main"><img src="images/ieeg_banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                    <p>In this tutorial, we will introduce core concepts essential in understanding sEEG. The aim of this tutorial is to provide practical information on sEEG for researchers new to this modality. Included is an overview of key concepts, learning exercises, and resources for further training in sEEG related research. <em>Correct answers for the learning exercises are at the end of this tutorial.</em></p>

                    <p>Scalp electroencephalography (sEEG) is a non-invasive method used to record electrical activity of the brain over time with electrodes placed on the scalp.</p>
                    <p>Electrodes used in sEEG are positioned on the scalp according to standardized systems such as the 10-20 system, which ensures consistent and reliable coverage of the scalp. Once in place, the electrodes detect electrical activity generated by neurons in the brain. This activity, measured in microvolts (µV) over time, reflects the synchronized firing of large groups of neurons. The captured signals provide crucial insights into brain function, and the mechanisms through which neurons generate this electrical activity will be explored further in Part 3.</p>
                    <p>When many neurons fire in a synchronized manner, their electrical activity generates an extracellular field that can be detected by the electrodes. However, the electrical signals detected by the electrodes are very weak, typically in the microvolt range. To make these signals measurable, the EEG system amplifies them. A key consideration in this process is that everything electrical on the scalp is amplified, including non-brain signals known as artifacts.</p>
                    <p>The amplified signals are displayed as waveforms, which represent brain activity across different frequency bands, such as delta (0.5-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-100 Hz). This waveform representation is a key method of visualizing EEG data. Additionally, by averaging EEG data that is time-locked to specific stimuli or events, researchers can extract event-related potentials (ERPs), which provide a more focused representation of brain responses to those stimuli. ERPs are discussed in more detail in part 4.</p>
                
<p>Practice Question:</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> A beginning researcher is designing a study to look at the real-time emotional response to images of nature. This researcher has decided to use scalp EEG for this project. What data representation approach will most likely be used in this study?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A)</strong> Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) – capturing brainwave patterns over extended periods, not directly linked to specific events</li>
    <li><strong>B)</strong> Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) – capturing time-locked brain responses to specific events or stimuli</li>
    <li><strong>C)</strong> Waveforms - capturing time-locked brain responses to specific events or stimuli</li>
</ul>

                    </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Considerations when choosing an EEG system</h5>
		    <p> EEG systems, such as sEEG, offer advantages including: real-time recording, millisecond resolution, direct measurement of neural activity, and are generally less expensive than other brain imaging modalities such as MRI and PET.  Subsequently, EEG is particularly suitable for investigating time-dependent phenomena, such as brief emotional states or fast neural processes.</p>

                    <p>Practice Question:</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 2:</strong> Imagine you are designing a study to investigate how the brain responds to sudden, unexpected sounds. You have access to various brain imaging techniques, including scalp EEG. Given the nature of your study, why might you choose scalp EEG over other techniques like fMRI or PET?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A)</strong> Because sEEG provides the best spatial resolution, allowing you to pinpoint the exact brain region involved.</li>
    <li><strong>B)</strong> Because sEEG is non-invasive and can measure brain activity with high temporal resolution, capturing the brain's response to sounds in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>C)</strong> Because sEEG is less affected by external noise, making it ideal for detecting subtle brain signals.</li>
    <li><strong>D)</strong> Because sEEG can directly visualize the structural changes in the brain caused by the sounds.</li>
</ul>

                    <p> Scalp EEG is a non-invasive method that is easier to perform, suitable for continuous monitoring, and poses lower risk to participants. It is best suited for assessing widespread brain activity rather than focusing on precise or deep brain regions. On the other hand, intracranial EEG is an invasive technique that requires the surgical implantation of electrodes. This approach allows for precise localization, making it ideal for investigating specific areas of brain activity and providing detailed insights into deep brain regions.</p>

                    <p>Practice Question:</p>

                    <p><strong>Question 3:</strong> Which of the following best describes when scalp EEG is preferred over intracranial EEG?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>A)</strong> When precise localization of deep brain activity is required.</li>
    <li><strong>B)</strong> For non-invasive monitoring of widespread brain activity.</li>
    <li><strong>C)</strong> To investigate specific areas of brain activity with high accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>D)</strong> When surgical implantation of electrodes is necessary.</li>
</ul>
