							<h1>Open Science & Data Sharing</h1>
<h1 id="fair-principles">FAIR Principles</h1>
<p>The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) are a set of guidelines to improve the management and sharing of research data. These principles ensure that data is prepared in a way that optimizes its reuse and reproducibility.</p>
<h3 id="findable">Findable</h3>
<p>Data should be easy to find by both humans and computers. This involves assigning a globally unique and persistent identifier to data, describing data with rich metadata, and indexing metadata in searchable resources. Clear and explicit identifiers should be included in metadata to facilitate search and discovery.</p>
<h3 id="accessible">Accessible</h3>
<p>Once data is found, it should be easy to access. This requires that data and metadata be retrievable via standardized communication protocols, which are open, free, and universally implementable. Where necessary, these protocols should support authentication and authorization. Additionally, metadata should remain accessible even if the data itself is no longer available.</p>
<h3 id="interoperable">Interoperable</h3>
<p>Data should be integrated with other data. This is achieved by using formal, accessible, shared, and widely applicable languages for knowledge representation. Data and metadata should use vocabularies that adhere to FAIR principles, and include qualified references to other data and metadata to ensure consistency and interoperability.</p>
<h3 id="reusable">Reusable</h3>
<p>Data should be reusable for future research. This means data and metadata should be richly described with accurate and relevant attributes. Data should be released with clear and accessible usage licenses, associated with detailed provenance information, and conform to community standards relevant to the domain.</p>
<p>Adopting the FAIR principles in your research ensures that your data is well-managed, easily shared, and readily available for future research. More information about the FAIR principles can be found on the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">GO FAIR website</a>.</p>
							
<h2><a href="index.html">Understanding BIDS for Neuroimaging Data</a></h2>
<h2 id="introduction-to-bids">Introduction to BIDS</h2>
<p><strong>BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)</strong> is a standardized way to organize and describe neuroimaging and behavioral data. It simplifies the process of data sharing, analysis, and collaboration in the neuroscience community. BIDS is designed to make data easier to use and to facilitate reproducible research.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-bids-">Why Use BIDS?</h2>
<p>BIDS offers several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardization</strong>: Ensures data consistency across studies.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Facilitates data sharing and collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Tool Compatibility</strong>: Compatible with various neuroimaging analysis tools.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Promotes reproducible research practices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a detailed overview, you can visit the <a href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io/">official BIDS website</a>.</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-bids">Key Features of BIDS</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>File Naming and Organization</strong>: BIDS specifies a consistent naming convention and folder structure.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Comprehensive metadata standards to describe data acquisition parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Data Types</strong>: Supports various data types, including MRI, MEG, EEG, iEEG, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Extensions</strong>: Allows for community-driven extensions to support new data types and modalities.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-bids">Getting Started with BIDS</h2>
<p>To start using BIDS, you can refer to the <a href="https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-starter-kit/">BIDS Starter Kit</a>. This resource provides templates, examples, and guidelines for converting your data to BIDS format.</p>
<h2 id="converting-data-to-bids-format">Converting Data to BIDS Format</h2>
<p>To simplify the process of converting neuroimaging data to BIDS format, various software tools known as BIDS converters have been developed. A non-exhaustive list of available BIDS converters can be found <a href="https://bids.neuroimaging.io/benefits">here</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the original and most popular BIDS converters, such as <strong>HeuDiConv</strong> and <strong>Dcm2Bids</strong>, require users to create custom code to specify the mapping between their imaging data and resulting BIDS output. However, newer tools have been developed to minimize or eliminate the need for coding by making educated guesses about the data&#39;s identity and suggesting the appropriate BIDS information and structure. For example, <strong>BIDScoin</strong> offers a graphical user interface (GUI), making it user-friendly, while <strong>ezBIDS</strong> takes a web-based approach. These newer tools are particularly useful for researchers who are less familiar with BIDS or not well-versed in the syntax and structure of the older converters. While the older BIDS converters provide more flexibility, the newer tools are designed to be more accessible and easier to use.</p>

ss this tool, go to the <a href="https://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/">BIDS Validator webpage</a></li>
<li><strong>BIDS Apps</strong>: Once you have converted data BIDS, you are ready to begin using BIDS apps, which are a collection of neuroimaging data analysis pipelines that accept BIDS-formatted data as input, such as MRIQC and fMRIPrep. Learn more in the <a href="https://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io/">BIDS App page</a></li>
